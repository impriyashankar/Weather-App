## General Information
I wanted to apply my knowledge of jquery into creating a simple app that uses even-handlers for user interaction.
Gameboard is creating a scoreboard that displays NBA scores from around the league. 
It allows the user to:
- Click the More link to see the dropdown menu, 
- Click the Share link to see the share menu, and
- Click the notification bell.

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
